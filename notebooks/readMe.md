Using the National Survey on Drug Use and Health to Predict Opioid Misuse

Objective: The aim of this study was to explore daily user-activity and opioid dependence and identify ways to improve the assessment of opioid risk. We are using marijuana as one of the data-points as gathering data for the rest is challenging within a weekend, however a similar model can be scaled up to accomodate other features

Data and Methods: This research utilized labeled datasets derived from the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU). Multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks were trained and tested on the two datasets to compare the effectiveness of survey and medical data.

Results: Although the prevalence of opioid dependence is approximately 1%, the classifiers trained using survey data were able to accurately predict subjects at risk for opioid dependence (sensitivity = .71, specificity = .80, AUC = .81) based on their history of marijuana use.

Conclusion: These results suggest that supervised machine learning can be employed to forecast opioid dependence through demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral features. The output also shows that having ever used marijuana (ever-use), a variable that is not included in the eICU data and the Opioid Risk Tool, is crucial for predicting opioid dependence. This highlights gaps in medical data that are presently being collected. The researchers suggest several approaches for improving opioid risk assessment.
